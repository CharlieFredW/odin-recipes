            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat a smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F (110 to 120 degrees C).</li> <br>
                    <li>Rinse turkey under cold water, and pat dry.</li> <br>
                    <li>Rub crushed garlic over the outside of the turkey, and sprinkle with seasoned salt. <br>
                        Transfer to a disposable roasting pan.</li> <br>
                    <li>Fill the turkey cavity with butter, cola, apple, onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. <br>
                        Cover turkey loosely with foil.</li> <br>
                    <li>Add wood chips to the smoker according to the manufacturer's directions. <br>
                        Place the roasting pan in the preheated smoker. <br>
                        Smoke the turkey, basting every 1 to 2 hours with juices from the bottom of the roasting pan, for 5 hours.</li> <br>
                    <li>Add more wood chips if desired. <br>
                        Continue smoking and basting, until turkey is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 5 more hours. <br>
                        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).</li>
