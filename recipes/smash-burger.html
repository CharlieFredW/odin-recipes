                    This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. <br>
                    Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. <br>
                    I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. <br>
                    These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go! <br>

            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. <br>
                        Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li> <br>
                    <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li> <br>
                    <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. <br>
                        Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. <br>
                        Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) <br>
                        and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. <br>
                        You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li> <br>
                    <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. <br>
                        Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. <br>
                        Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. <br>
                        Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
                </ol>
